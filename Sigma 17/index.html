    <p class="important">This is an important paragraph and all elements of important class are coloures in aqua colour</p>
    <div>
        This is not a paragraph
        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "important"> 
        This is a div of important class
        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div of important class. But this is coloures according to the property "div > p". And not the property of important class</p>
        <span>
            <p> This is a para inside a span which is inside a div. Hence child prperty (div > p) not used. Instead Desecendant selector(div p) is used</p>
        </span>
    </div>
    <div id="conclusion",  class="important">
        This is a div with id=conclusion. So its not following div's style but following its own id's style.
        Also this div has class="important", but id's style has been given priority.
    </div>
